# The Jaren model format (`jaren-model`)

This document is normative. The key words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD and
MAY are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Canonical schema: [`schemas/jaren-model.schema.json`](../schemas/jaren-model.schema.json)
(draft 2020-12), with the mechanically derived draft-07 twin beside it.

Section allocation is fixed: §§1–7 are written here; §§8–11 are
reserved, numbered placeholders owned by later work, so no two
documents ever claim the same section number.

## 1. Scope

A **model document** declares the collections of a store: each
collection is a JSON Schema for its documents, a key declaration, and
a set of declared indexes. `openStore(model, { driver, ... })` opens
(or creates) a database through an injected **driver**, applies the
physical mapping through a **dialect**, and gives transactional,
schema-validated reads and writes.

This is version `0.1` — the storage subset. Every collection is an
entity with no relations and a single JSON document column. Later
versions add vocabulary to THIS format; they do not add a second
format. Querying, migrations, entities and change capture are outside
this document's scope and own their reserved sections below.

The store runs over SQLite — on Node (`@jarenjs/db/node`), on Bun
(`@jarenjs/db/bun`), and in a browser against an injected wasm handle
(`@jarenjs/db/wasm`) — and promises nothing else.

## 2. The model document

```json
{
  "$model": "0.1",
  "collections": {
    "users": {
      "schema": { "type": "object", "required": ["id", "email"],
                  "properties": { "id": {"type": "string"},
                                  "email": {"type": "string", "format": "email"},
                                  "age": {"type": "integer"} } },
      "key": "/id",
      "indexes": [
        { "name": "by_email", "path": "$.email", "unique": true },
        { "name": "by_age", "path": "$.age" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- `$model` MUST be `"0.1"`.
- `collections` MUST carry at least one collection; names MUST be
  identifiers (`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`).
- `schema` MUST be an object schema — it is what stored documents
  validate against (§5) and the type source for indexed paths (§3).
- `key` is an RFC 6901 pointer to the caller-supplied key member, and
  MUST select at least one member — or `null` when the store
  allocates keys (§6).
- `indexes[].path` is a JSONPath expression that MUST be **singular**:
  it selects exactly one member per document. Wildcards, slices,
  filters, descendants and function calls are not indexable; a
  non-singular path is rejected at open with `JD0004` naming the
  expression. A composite index takes a non-empty array of paths.
- Index names MUST be identifiers, unique within their collection.

An invalid model document is `JD0005` with a `docPath` pointing at the
offending member. Model checking happens before any database work.

## 3. Physical mapping

Each collection maps to one table, rendered entirely by the dialect —
no SQL text exists outside a dialect. On SQLite:

- a `key` column (`PRIMARY KEY`, typed from the key declaration),
- a `doc` column holding the document as JSONB in a `BLOB` column of a
  `STRICT` table,
- one **virtual generated column** per distinct indexed path, typed
  from the collection's schema at that path (`string` → `TEXT`,
  `integer` → `INTEGER`, `number` → `REAL`, `boolean` → `INTEGER`,
  undeclared → `ANY`), and
- one index per `indexes` entry, named `<collection>_<index name>`,
  over the generated columns of its paths.

Index paths are analyzed through the query engine's published AST: a
path is indexable exactly when the analysis reports it singular and
every segment is a plain member or index selection. The collection's
schema is the type source — the mapping needs no engine-side type
inference.

Two indexes over the same path share one generated column. A member
name the dialect's JSON path grammar cannot carry (an embedded `"` or
a control character, on SQLite) is `JD0004`.

**Opening an existing database verifies, never alters.** If a declared
collection's table already exists, its columns (name, type, generated)
and its created indexes (name, uniqueness, covered columns) MUST match
what the model would create; any disagreement is `JD0002` naming the
first difference. Reshaping a live database is the migration story — a
later capability — and `openStore` MUST NOT attempt it.

## 4. The driver contract and the synchronous fast path

A driver is `{ name, dialect, open(path, options) }`; `open` returns a
`Connection` or a promise of one:

```
Connection = {
  synchronous,                 // boolean
  capabilities,                // read once at open — see below
  exec(sql), prepare(sql), transaction(fn), close(),
  registerFunction(name, options, fn) | null,
  registerAggregate(name, spec) | null,
  session(table) | null
}
Statement = { run(params), get(params), all(params), iterate(params) }
```

Every method MAY return a value or a promise; the store never assumes
either. Parameters bind positionally as arrays.

**Capabilities** are read once at open — from the library's version
report, its compile options, and the binding's declaration — and are
the single source of truth for feature gating. The table covers at
least: `version`, `jsonb`, `generatedColumns`, `returning`, `upsert`,
`savepoints`, `rtree`, `fts`, `sessions`, `userFunctions`,
`deterministicIndexableFunctions`, `alterTableFull`, plus two slots
that are **empty (`false`) on every SQLite driver**:
`statementTimeout` and `rowEstimates`. SQLite exposes no interrupt, no
progress handler and no row-estimate API; a driver that cannot do a
thing MUST say so here rather than degrade silently. The slots exist
so a driver that has the facts can fill them without a contract
change.

On the Bun binding, `userFunctions`,
`deterministicIndexableFunctions` and `sessions` are `false` by
construction: `bun:sqlite` exposes no `function`, no `aggregate` and
no `createSession`.

A library below SQLite **3.45** fails at open with `JD0001` naming
the version found.

**The public store API is asynchronous.** Every store and collection
method returns a promise, because a browser store over OPFS is
asynchronous no matter what backend sits behind it. Where — and only
where — `connection.synchronous` is `true`, the store also carries
`store.sync`:

```js
store.sync.collection('users').get(key)   // the same read, no promise
store.sync.transaction(fn)
```

`store.sync` is **absent** on an asynchronous driver — not a set of
throwing stubs — so feature-testing it is honest. The asynchronous
surface allocates exactly one promise per call (the internal
composition is sync-capable and adds none); the measured difference is
the price of portability, published with the benchmarks rather than
waved away.

**Concurrency defaults are decided here.** A file-backed store opens
with `PRAGMA busy_timeout` set to **5000 ms** and journal mode
**WAL**, both overridable through `openStore`'s `busyTimeout` and
`journalMode` options; `:memory:` stores set neither. The values in
effect are visible on `store.capabilities.busyTimeoutMs` and
`store.capabilities.journalMode` (`null` for in-memory stores).

The runtime builtin behind a binding is imported lazily inside
`open()` — never at module scope — so every driver subpath loads under
every runtime; on a runtime without the builtin, `open` fails with
`JD0003`. The root `@jarenjs/db` subpath never references a runtime
builtin at all.

## 5. Writes and transactions

```js
const store = await openStore(model, { driver, compileSchema });
const users = store.collection('users');

await users.insert(doc);            // JD2001 when the key exists
await users.put(doc);               // upsert
await users.patch(key, jsonPatch);  // RFC 6902, applied in the database
await users.delete(key);            // resolves false when nothing was stored
await users.get(key);               // resolves undefined when absent
await store.transaction(fn);        // savepoint-nested, returns fn's value
```

**Writes validate through the injected hook.** `compileSchema` has the
`compileTypeTest` signature: it takes a collection's schema and
returns a validation function; the function returns `true`/`false` or
`{ valid, errors }`. A rejected write is `JD2003` carrying the hook's
`errors` when it produced any. Without a hook, writes are unvalidated
and `store.capabilities.validated === false` — a declared downgrade.
The cost of running without one: the database constraints only see the
key and the indexed members; everything else is stored as given.
`@jarenjs/db` never imports `@jarenjs/validate`.

**`patch` validates the result, then updates in place.** The patch is
applied to the stored document with the copy-on-write engine and the
RESULT is validated (`JD2003` rejects before any SQL). The operations
are then translated to the dialect's JSON-set primitives so a
one-field update does not rewrite a large document. Translatable in
0.1: `replace`, `add` of an object member, `add` at an array's end,
and `remove`. Anything else — `test`, `move`, `copy`, a mid-array
insert — falls back to a whole-document write. The fallback is
**counted and exposed** at `collection.stats()`
(`{ patchTranslated, patchFallback }`), measured rather than assumed.
A malformed patch document raises the json family's own coded errors
unchanged; `patch` on an absent key is `JD2006`.

**`transaction(fn)` nests via savepoints.** `fn` receives the store
and may itself call `transaction`; each level is one savepoint. A
throw rolls back exactly its own level and rethrows — an outer
transaction that catches the error continues and its own work
commits. There is no implicit retry.

## 6. Identity

Key allocation is declared, never guessed (three strategies, platform
primitives only):

| declaration | strategy | `insert` returns |
|---|---|---|
| `"key": "/id"` | caller-supplied: the key is read from the document at the pointer | the extracted key |
| `"key": null, "identity": "uuid"` | `crypto.randomUUID()`, stored in the key column only | the allocated UUID |
| `"key": null, "identity": "integer"` | database-allocated integer key | the allocated integer |

A caller-keyed document whose pointer resolves to nothing or to a
non-scalar is `JD2002`; so is an explicit key argument that is not a
string or a number. For allocated identities, `put(doc, key)` updates
a known document and `put(doc)` allocates.

## 7. Error codes

`DbCompileError` (`JD0xxx`, problems opening a store) and
`DbRuntimeError` (`JD2xxx`, problems reading or writing one) build on
the suite's coded contract: a stable `code`, a bare `reason`, a
composed `message`, a `docPath` into the model document where one
exists — and, on runtime errors, the `collection` and (where known)
the `key` as own properties. Database errors are wrapped, never leaked
raw: the reason keeps the original text, `cause` keeps the original
error.

| code | raised when |
|---|---|
| `JD0001` | the SQLite library is below the supported floor |
| `JD0002` | the declared model disagrees with the existing database |
| `JD0003` | the driver binding is unavailable on this runtime |
| `JD0004` | an index path is not a singular member selection |
| `JD0005` | the model document is invalid |
| `JD2001` | insert found the key already present |
| `JD2002` | a usable key could not be resolved for the write |
| `JD2003` | the write failed schema validation |
| `JD2004` | an undeclared collection was requested |
| `JD2005` | a database operation failed |
| `JD2006` | patch found no document at the key |

The table above is proven in sync with the runtime `DB_CODES` table by
a test.
